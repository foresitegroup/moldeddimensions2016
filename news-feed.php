<h2>Molded Dimensions: Where Great People Choose to Work</h2>
<strong>By Dianna Brodine, managing editor, Inside Rubber | January 2019</strong><br>
<br>

Molded Dimensions LLC has been in business since 1954. The company moved to Port Washington, Wisconsin, in 1973, where it has grown into a 100+-employee, three- shift facility with four separate divisions: rubber, cast urethane, moldmaking and strategic sourcing. President Mike and CEO Linda Katz purchased the business in 2001, and its project base focuses on low- to medium-volume custom manufacturing. This niche serves Molded Dimensions well, keeping its customer portfolio diversified and ensuring a continuous stream of interesting technical projects.<br>

<br>

Her father, Lorand Spyers-Duran, launched plastics injection molder Sussex, Wis.-based Sussex Plastics Inc.&mdash;now called Susses IM Inc.&mdash;in 1977, which gave the 10-year-old an opportunity to view first-hand what it was like to work in a factory.<br>

<h2>Molded Dimensions Named TOP WORKPLACES</h2>
Port Washington, WI, June 2015 - On Friday, June 12th 2015, Molded Dimensions, was honored by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel as one of the Top Workplaces in southeast Wisconsin. This is the fourth year in a row MD has earned this esteemed award.<br>
<br>

Several months ago, MD employees were surveyed. It is from the workplace survey responses that MD was chosen as a Top Workplaces company. The MD responses are compared to local and national averages in the areas of execution, work environment, connection, company direction, supervisions, and pay/benefits. MD continues to beat the industry averages by as much as 40% on these criteria.<br>

<h2>Molded Dimensions expands in pieces</h2>
<strong>By Tom Held of Milwaukee Business Journal | June 12, 2015</strong><br>
<br>

Linda Katz enjoys watching a tractor, airplane or motorcycle on the move and thinking: "I have a little piece of that."<br>
<br>

The owner and CEO of Molded Dimensions will have more of those moments as the business expands this fall from its base in Port Washington to 21,000 feet of space in two buildings it purchased from Great Lakes Marine Services on Highway W in Grafton.<br>
<br>

One of the former Great Lakes Marine buildings will be used to house KM Tooling, a machine and tool shop Molded Dimensions bought in October.<br>

<br>

The award was presented last week by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.<br>
<br>

The process drew 1,121 nominations, with 150 companies earning the recognition. It was the third year in a row Molded Dimensions has been named one of the Top 100 Workplaces in southeast Wisconsin.

<h2>Parts maker Molded Dimensions focuses on learning, performing</h2>
<strong>By Rick Barrett of the Journal Sentinel | May 18, 2012</strong><br>
<br>

If new hires at Molded Dimensions make it through the first year or two, CEO Linda Katz says there's a good chance they will still be working at the company a decade later.<br>
<br>

There's some turnover at the Port Washington maker of rubber and polyurethane parts, but most of it occurs in the first 24 months. After that, Katz says, employees are likely to settle in and take advantage of benefits such as company-paid college tuition.<br>
<br>

"We are very big education advocates," said Katz, who has a degree in mechanical engineering and material science from Duke University.<br>

<h2>Paddling Partner offers a bit of stability</h2>
<strong>By Mark Jaeger of the Ozaukee Press | January 6, 2010</strong><br>
<br>

[Vopal] looked for other solutions and found his answer much closer to home, at Port Washington's Molded Dimensions.<br>
<br>

"We looked all over the country, but found a great team right in Port with Aaron Stanek, Carol Nikolaus and Ehan Khan," Vopal said.<br>
<br>

Switching the material to urethane, which Molded Dimensions works with regularly, proved to be the key.<br>
<br>

It provides a solid base, with a nylon bolt connecting the 9.5 pound BB-filled canister to a flexible, black frame. The device is portable, easily installed and removed without damaging the boat.<br>
