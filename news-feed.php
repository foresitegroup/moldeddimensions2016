<h2>Molded Dimensions: Where Great People Choose to Work</h2>
<strong>By Dianna Brodine, managing editor, Inside Rubber | January 2019</strong><br>
<br>

Molded Dimensions LLC has been in business since 1954. The company moved to Port Washington, Wisconsin, in 1973, where it has grown into a 100+-employee, three- shift facility with four separate divisions: rubber, cast urethane, moldmaking and strategic sourcing. President Mike and CEO Linda Katz purchased the business in 2001, and its project base focuses on low- to medium-volume custom manufacturing. This niche serves Molded Dimensions well, keeping its customer portfolio diversified and ensuring a continuous stream of interesting technical projects.<br>

<h2>Molded Dimensions Named TOP WORKPLACES</h2>

<br>

Several months ago, MD employees were surveyed. It is from the workplace survey responses that MD was chosen as a Top Workplaces company. The MD responses are compared to local and national averages in the areas of execution, work environment, connection, company direction, supervisions, and pay/benefits. MD continues to beat the industry averages by as much as 40% on these criteria.<br>

<h2>Molded Dimensions expands in pieces</h2>

Two Port Washington companies, Molded Dimensions and independent insurance agency Ansay &amp; Associates, have been named two of the top workplaces in Wisconsin based on a polling of company employees.<br>
<br>

The award was presented last week by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.<br>
<br>

The process drew 1,121 nominations, with 150 companies earning the recognition. It was the third year in a row Molded Dimensions has been named one of the Top 100 Workplaces in southeast Wisconsin. With Linda Katz as chief executive officer, Molded Dimensions is a certified woman-owned business. The company, which has been in business for more than 60 years, has two manufacturing facilities in Port Washington. It produces molded and cast polyurethane mechanical components.<br>

<h2>Parts maker Molded Dimensions focuses on learning, performing</h2>
<strong>By Rick Barrett of the Journal Sentinel | May 18, 2012</strong><br>
<br>

If new hires at Molded Dimensions make it through the first year or two, CEO Linda Katz says there's a good chance they will still be working at the company a decade later.<br>
<br>

There's some turnover at the Port Washington maker of rubber and polyurethane parts, but most of it occurs in the first 24 months. After that, Katz says, employees are likely to settle in and take advantage of benefits such as company-paid college tuition.<br>
<br>

"We are very big education advocates," said Katz, who has a degree in mechanical engineering and material science from Duke University.<br>

<h2>Paddling Partner offers a bit of stability</h2>
<strong>By Mark Jaeger of the Ozaukee Press | January 6, 2010</strong><br>
<br>

[Vopal] looked for other solutions and found his answer much closer to home, at Port Washington's Molded Dimensions.<br>
<br>

"We looked all over the country, but found a great team right in Port with Aaron Stanek, Carol Nikolaus and Ehan Khan," Vopal said.<br>
<br>

Switching the material to urethane, which Molded Dimensions works with regularly, proved to be the key.<br>
<br>

It provides a solid base, with a nylon bolt connecting the 9.5 pound BB-filled canister to a flexible, black frame. The device is portable, easily installed and removed without damaging the boat.<br>
