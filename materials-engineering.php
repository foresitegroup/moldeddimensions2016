<h1>Engineered Elastomer Formulations</h1>
Materials engineering and formula design is a key piece of Molded Dimensions, LLC's rubber and cast urethane manufacturing philosophy. This ensures we produce high quality, engineered product that meets and exceeds our customer's expectations. To accomplish this goal, we maintain an on-site Chemist and laboratory. With over 25 years in the industry, our Chemist's experience and expertise benefit our customers with high quality, cost efficient formulations.<br>
<br>

<img class="one-half-right" src="images/mat-eng1.jpg" alt="Rubber parts may be REACH, RoHS and Conflict Minerals compliant.">
The Chemist's primary focus includes:
<ul>
  <li>Formula development</li>
  <li>Formula improvement</li>
  <li>Special material formulation and certification</li>
  <li>REACH, RoHS and Conflict Mineral certifications</li>
  <li>Material property testing</li>
  <li>GlocalSource product conformance</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h2>Formula Development</h2>
MD processes thermoset elastomers, <a href="rubber-molding.php">Rubber</a> and <a href="polyurethane-molding.php">Polyurethane</a>. Compounds can be specifically formulated to provide the optimum properties for each unique application. New rubber and polyurethane formulas are continuously being developed to meet marketplace demand and application, including chloramine resistance, electrical conductivity, electrical resistivity and custom color matching.<br>
<br>

<h2>Formula Improvement</h2>
Existing formulas are customized for the specific molding process to maximize processability, and to minimize the finishing process. Beyond compound formulation, cost containment is a fundamental goal of our Chemist.<br>
<br>

<h2>Special Material Formulation and Certification</h2>
When an application requires industry standard certifications, our Chemist steps up to the plate. Materials may be certified for compliance in-house or by using a third party material testing and certification facility including:
<ul>
  <li>ATSM D2000 requirements</li>
  <li>3A</li>
  <li>NSF</li>
  <li>FDA</li>
  <li>UL94 flammability</li>
</ul>
<br>

Molded Dimensions is well-versed in the latest international regulatory initiatives:
<ul>
  <li>REACH</li>
  <li>RoHS</li>
  <li>Conflict Minerals compliance</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h2>Material Property Testing</h2>
<img class="one-half-right" src="images/mat-eng2.jpg" alt="Milled rubber material may be 3A, NSF, or UL94 compliant.">
MD has an on-site materials laboratory for testing and certifying that incoming raw materials meet physical property requirements as part of our Quality program. The laboratory is utilized in our material compounding and design program. The testing equipment measures various material properties including:
<ul>
  <li>Hardness</li>
  <li>Tensile and elongation</li>
  <li>Compression set</li>
  <li>Rebound</li>
  <li>Flammability resistance</li>
  <li>Heat resistance</li>
  <li>Tear resistance</li>
  <li>Surface resistivity</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h2>GlocalSource Product Conformance</h2>
Our <a href="glocalsource.php">GlocalSource</a> service package includes material confirmation of all incoming product lots to ensure the proper raw material is utilized and meets customer specifications.<br>
<br>

Materials engineering is a large part of our rubber and polyurethane manufacturing success. Our on-site Chemist and laboratory ensure Molded Dimensions provides superior material compounding and testing service.
