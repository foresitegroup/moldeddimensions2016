<h1>World Class Product Development</h1>
At Molded Dimensions, we are proud to be a highly engineering oriented company. Superior technical competence is something you will experience right from the start. Our product development process is considered best in class and includes:
<ul>
  <li>Project Review</li>
  <li>Project Management</li>
  <li>Material Engineering</li>
  <li>Quality</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project Review</h2>
<img class="one-half-right" src="images/product-dev2.jpg" alt="Rubber and urethane part project reviews.">
The review process starts as soon as the RFQ is received. The technical sales team examines the part design, critical features, and operating environment to ensure the material and design support both manufacturing standards and part function. The review also highlights possible cost saving opportunities. The technical sales team works hand in hand with MD's on-site chemist and engineers until a project is launched and an engineering Project Manager is assigned.<br>

<h2>Project Management</h2>
At project launch, an engineering Project Manager is assigned and meets with the technical sales team and tooling designer. After this second project review, including part design, tooling design and process design, the Project Manager becomes the hub of the project, handling all activities and communication. The Project Manager draws on the skills of our design engineering, materials engineering - including an on-site, degreed Chemist - process engineering, and quality team to complete the project on time. The product development process concludes with a cross-departmental meeting upon part approval to review the overall project and ensure successful production launch<br>

<h2>Materials Engineering</h2>
Every application has a unique set of requirements that dictates a particular type of material. Those requirements can include factors such as: service environment, physical properties requirements, and special requirements such as FDA, NSF or 3A Compliance. We have custom formulated over 800 rubber and polyurethane compounds for a wide range of applications. Our on-site Chemist has over 25 years in the industry. His experience and expertise benefit our customers with high quality, cost efficient formulations.<br>

<h2>Quality</h2>
Quality is in our culture, processes and methodologies. It is by design that new product quality expectations are reviewed during the quoting stage, again after project kickoff and once more during our post part approval meeting. The part requirements and specifications become part of our part and process documentation for not only the first production run, but for each and every future production run. Our production team utilizes this documentation as inspectors at each and every stage of the process.<br>
