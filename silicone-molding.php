<p>Thanks to its versatility and durability, high-consistency silicone rubber (HCR) can be found in a wide variety of applications. Components commonly made from this material include gaskets, handgrips, O-rings and other custom-molded parts. It’s no wonder that industries of all kinds depend on high-quality HCR injection molding for their product lines. Molded Dimensions provides comprehensive silicone rubber injection molding as part of our overall elastomer services, and we bring the same attention to detail and level of engineering expertise to it as we do to all our work.</p>
<br>


<h2>How the Process Works</h2>
<p>The HCR silicone injection molding process typically involves heating the raw material and injecting it under high pressure into a mold. The injection screw preheats the silicone, reducing its viscosity and enabling it to flow with greater ease into the mold cavity. The rubber fills the cavity completely, ensuring the resulting component will be of the highest quality with minimal defects.</p>
<p>Among the many advantages of silicone injection molding over other forms of production, such as silicone compression molding, is that pre-forms aren’t required. This effectively eliminates a step and saves a considerable amount of time. The preheating at the beginning of the molding cycle also helps reduce curing time because the mold cavities are filled with greater speed. This method provides other benefits, such as minimizing waste through greater control over the amount of raw material introduced into the molds.</p>
