Molded Dimensions has added four significant pieces of capital equipment in 2018.  The goal around these purchases was to bring the level of technology up to the best that is currently available, improve our uptime and quality, and to expand our capabilities beyond traditional limits.  To that end, we have made the following purchases...<br>
<br>

<strong>New Urethane Casting Machine</strong><br>
Our main casting machine was over 40 years old and performed well for much of the work that went through it.  However, there were limitations in the amount of material that could be cast per minute and there were ergonomic concerns with the machine.  We replaced the machine with a state-of-the-art new machine.  We have increased our filling speed capability by a factor of about three and the resulting parts are cosmetically much improved.  The increased throughput helps us stay on our promised delivery schedule.  The safeguards in the controls make it difficult to either harm the machine or pour parts that are not at the correct resin vs cure ratio.  The new machine also has an articulating pouring head that makes it much easier to take the pouring to the mold versus pushing a heavy mold to the pouring.  This has been a big hit with the operators.  With a strong preventive maintenance plan the machine uptime is predictable and reliable.<br>

<strong>New Injection Molding Presses</strong><br>
We felt it was time to cycle out a couple of our injection presses this year as well.  One of the presses was nearly 20 years old and finding spare parts had become more and more difficult, both for the press and the computer that runs it.  We took the opportunity to upgrade to a new 300 ton machine with all the bells and whistles.  The increased uptime and reliability has been a nice improvement for our manufacturing group.  We liked the new press so well that we ordered another one to replace a "low-tech" injection press that has been sitting nearly dormant for the last few years.  By swapping out this press we feel like we got a bump in capacity and are better utilizing valuable floor space.  Training for our operators was measured in hours as the presses are very operator friendly and only an improvement from what we have been used to running.  The new generation software allow for more control of the meaningful portions of the molding cycle.<br>
<br>

<strong>Ram Injection Press</strong><br>
As our business continues to grow we found the need for an additional 24"x24" ram injection press.  Our application is fairly unique, so we found a used press that was reconditioned to our specifications and outfitted with a custom made injection unit.  Although we are still in the commissioning phase with this press, the result will be a 300 ton press with increased shot capacity and a better ergonomic design.  The firm that built the press for us did a good job and we are in the process of making some additional modifications to better suit our needs.  The added capacity will be welcome when we are up and running in October.  We should see some quality improvements in larger parts due to the increased size of the injection unit as well.<br>
