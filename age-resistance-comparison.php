<h1>AGE RESISTANCE COMPARISON</h1>
Age resistance generally associated with products fabricated from various rubbers. This table, taken from MIL_HDBK-695C, is quite conservative.<br>
<br>

<h2>Maximum (up to 20 years)</h2>
Silicone<br>
Fluorocarbon<br>
<br>

<h2>Average (5 to 10 years)</h2>
Hypalon<br>
EPDM<br>
Butyl<br>
Neoprene<br>
Polyether urethane<br>
Hydrin<br>
<br>

<h2>Minimum (3 to 5)</h2>
Nitrile, Buna N<br>
SBR<br>
Natural Rubber<br>
Polyester urethane<br>
<br>

Use care when using and interpreting this table, because Nitrile when compounded using age resistance additives may have a shelf life of up to 10 years. In addition, warehousing environmental factors affect actual shelf life.
