We have exciting news at Molded Dimensions: we have added an equity partner for our business, Shoreview Industries from Minneapolis. We are excited that our new partner will add expertise and courage for strategic growth that beneﬁts our customers and employees.<br>
<br>

My father, who was also a thriving manufacturing business owner, always said, "A business needs to constantly grow and innovate, or it will perish." Often small businesses bump up against the $10M sales mark and get stuck because they are unable to move to the next level. We are proud to have grown steadily to over $20M in sales while adding capabilities like tool-making, automated inspection, and urethane machine pouring. We want to be sure we continue to grow and innovate.<br>
<br>

In addition to our regular 10% organic internal growth, with Shoreview's support we hope to also acquire new capacity and capabilities through an acquisition or two. Over the past ten years, we have looked at lots of small businesses that would be excellent teammates for Molded Dimensions, but we were too chicken to take action for two reasons. First, we were uncomfortable risking the assets of our Employee Owners who owned 36% of MDI, and second, we lacked the experience to buy a company and fold it in. Now in addition to some of my shares, Shoreview has purchased all our ESOP shares and our employees can roll those funds into pretax IRA's where they can grow until retirement. We have also added a generous 401K match so employees can also save for retirement a new way. But most importantly, Shoreview has a fabulous track record of successfully purchasing and linking companies just like ours, so we are very excited to help Molded Dimensions grow with Shoreview's support.<br>
<br>

We selected Shoreview because they share our midwestern values. They are committed to growing employment in our current location. Their debt position is extremely conservative, which will provide security for our employees and customers through future economic downturns. They are highly recommended in our local business community as ethical, patient, strategic, helpful partners, and we are thrilled to have them on board.<br>
<br>

Mike and I, as well as the entire management team, remain in our current roles and have equity stakes in the company. Additionally, I remain on the board of directors. We look forward to seeing how our new structure will allow Molded Dimensions to grow with you. If you have ideas for a technology or capability we should target to beneﬁt your business, please let us know.<br>
<br>

Sincerely, Linda Katz
