<h1>SQUARENESS</h1>
Squareness is the quality of being at an angle of 90&deg; such as "surface must be square with axis". A tolerance of 2&deg; should be allowed for rubber srfaces that are not ground.<br>

<h2>Rubber Product with Metal Insert</h2>
Example:<br>
Rubber-to-metal product in Sketch 1 Fig 6. Rubber surface B-B is square with axis A-A as the angle is true 90&deg;. Sketch 2 indicates the same example with 2&deg; tolerances exaggerated.<br>
<br>

Note: This type of product requires closer control than is usually normal with commercial products.
