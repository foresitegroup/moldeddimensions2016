<h1>Ownership Makes a Difference</h1>
<img class="one-fourth-right" src="images/ourcompany1.jpg" alt="">
WBE certification and employee ownership set Molded Dimensions, Inc. apart from other manufacturing companies. In 2001, Linda Katz purchased MDI along with the employees. Linda holds the majority ownership and we are proud to be certified as a Women's Business Enterprise (WBE). Our employees hold minority ownership in an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP).

MDI values diversity in our business. It starts with our Women's Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC) certification as a Women's Business Enterprise. Our diversity continues throughout our organization, including ethnic and gender leadership roles, down through the ranks to our front line operators. We truly believe diversity brings problem solving and creative thinking into our business. This conscious approach to business diversity makes MDI a stronger organization.

Becoming an ESOP company in 2001 prompted new thinking on how our business functions. As the ownership culture developed, our employees recognized the important advantage over employees of traditional companies. We have significant influence on the quality and reputation of MDI's products and services. Ownership gives employees incentive to work harder and smarter, produce better quality product and be more innovative. Each and every employee, from Tool Makers on first shift to Press Operators on third shift, benefits from the ESOP. Each is an owner, and MDI's business is stronger because of it. Our customers see the positive results.
