Molded Dimensions is a custom molder of rubber and cast polyurethane. At MD, we take pride in the technical excellence and versatility of our rubber business unit. Our business supports:
<ul>
  <li>Wide range of <em>thermoset polymers</em>, from the basic EPDM to a highly engineered Fluoroelastomer</li>
  <li>Broad span of <em>annual volumes</em> - low, mid, and high volume production capabilities</li>
  <li>Large variety of <em>applications</em> - simple grommet applications, tightly-toleranced, and precision-molded diaphragms, complex hoses, highly-cosmetic medical applications, and much more</li>
  <li>Significant diversity in <em>part size</em>, from small parts that fit on a fingertip, to large parts that need to be carried with two hands</li>
  <li>Multiple <em>molding technologies</em> - compression molded, transfer molded, and high speed, injection molded product</li>
  <li><em>Insert molding capabilities</em> - we can overmold rubber onto metallic (stainless or carbon steel, aluminum, etc.) and non-metallic structural components such as fiberglass and glass-filled thermoplastics</li>
  <li>Many <em>value-added operations</em>, including deflashing, grinding, kitting, assembly, testing, along with Kanban and inventory programs</li>
  <li>Wide <em>range of industries</em> from "medical to mining"</li>
</ul>

<h2>Annual Volume Sold</h2>
MD has low, mid, and high volume production capabilities. Some of our customers, including military, often only require small production runs, while other customers require weekly releases and a supporting KanBan program to keep them in supply. The systems and methodologies we learn from larger, more structured companies can be applied to benefit customers across the board.<br>

<h2>Part or Product Size</h2>
Precision mechanical components range in size from 1 gram to over 30 pounds. In-house production utilizes presses from 8" square to 24" square, and our GlocalSource presses have capabilities up to 60" square.<br>
<br>

<h2>Molding Technologies</h2>
Multiple size presses are used to meet your program requirements. Molding technologies include:
<ul>
  <li>Injection - Strip form material is drawn into the press, heated, and then forced into the mold cavity under controlled pressure, temperature, and injection speeds.</li>
  <li>Ram-Injection - Billets of material are manually loaded each heat, or press cycle, into a secondary hydraulic ram, which then forces the rubber into a closed mold cavity.</li>
  <li>Transfer - A "preform" of material is placed between the top mold plate and an additional ram plate. This method uses the closing press to transfer rubber into the cavity. A block of material is placed in a "pot" and then, with a punch, forced into the mold cavity.</li>
  <li>Compression - A pre-sized, mass of rubber is set directly into the mold cavity and then squeezed into shape as the mold plates close around it.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h2>Insert Molding</h2>
When additional structure is needed in a component, rubber materials may be overmolded onto a substrate. A variety of metals including carbon steel, aluminum, stainless, brass and bronze can be used. Non-metallic, rigid materials, such as fiberglass and glass filled nylon, are also candidates.<br>
<br>

Rubber may be either mechanically or chemically bonded to an insert. Mechanical bond is the encapsulation of the substrate without the use of a secondary adhesive. A chemical bond utilizes an adhesive system to ensure an unyielding bond between the substrate and urethane.<br>
<br>

<h2>Finishing Operations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Deflashing - During the molding process, uncured rubber can seep between plates causing excess material extending from the part. This flash or excess material is removed in a batch process called cryogenic deflashing. The parts are frozen using liquid nitrogen, tumbled and blasted with media to remove the flash while retaining the part integrity.</li>
  <li>Machining and Grinding - Machining or grinding can be used to achieve tighter tolerances than molding alone can create.</li>
  <li>Kitting - Products may be special packaged, labeled or assembled per customer requirements.</li>
  <li>Inventory Programs - Flexible systems, including KANBAN, are set up to hold raw, WIP and/or finished goods inventory domestically or abroad depending on customer need.</li>
</ul>
<br>
