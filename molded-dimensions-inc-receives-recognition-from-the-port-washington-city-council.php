December 2015 &mdash; Linda Katz accepted the 2015 Business Recognition Award from the Port Washington City Council on behalf of all the employees at Molded Dimensions, Inc..  Port Washington, Wisconsin is a city of over 12,000 residents located 25 miles north of Milwaukee on the beautiful shore of Lake Michigan.  Manufacturing is integral to the growth and success of the city and represents over 27% of employment.  Molded Dimensions is proud to call Port Washington our home for over 4 decades.<br>
<br>

<img src="images/port-washington-award.png" alt="" style="float: left; margin: 0 1em 1em 0;">Molded Dimensions has grown in Port Washington because of the City's commitment to partnering with the business.  In 2008, the city approved an IRB to help finance a second facility.  They have been a fantastic ambassador for growing the downtown to attract great businesses and restaurants, and working to keep the schools top notch so that manufacturers, like Molded Dimensions, can have a well-educated workforce.  The Port Washington City leadership over the years has helped Molded Dimensions grow from a handful of employees and 15,000 square feet of manufacturing space in 1973, to 90 employees and 50,000 square feet in Port and an additional 20,000 square feet in nearby Grafton.  For all of this Molded Dimensions is grateful. It is an honor for us to be awarded this year's Business Recognition Award.<br>
